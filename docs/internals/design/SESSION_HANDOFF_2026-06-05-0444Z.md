# Session handoff — 2026-06-05 04:44 UTC

**Date**: 2026-06-05 (single continuation session, 11 PRs merged: #340–#350)
**Outgoing model**: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context)
**Format defined in**: `CLAUDE.md` § "Preparing a new session (handoff convention)"

## TL;DR

Cleared the integrator-bug backlog: tenant-delete cascade (#223), the two API-correctness issues (#329/#331), and the four downstream-integrator bugs (#224 property JSON, #237 Cypher params, #226 admin CLI, #248 HNSW framing). **No open issues remain.** Along the way, found and fixed a CI gap that let a red `pkg/api` test merge under green CI — `make test` never ran `pkg/api`/`pkg/graphql`.

## What's done this session

| PR | Title | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| #340 | tenant-delete cascade (closes #223) | DeleteTenant cascades nodes/edges/vector-index/LSA; WAL-durable; LSA on-disk unlink avoids resurrection. |
| #341 | OpenAPI `uint64`→`int64` (closes #329) | 18 integer-ID schemas → standard `format: int64`. |
| #342 | `/traverse` honors `direction`+`edge_types` (closes #331) | Was decoded + silently ignored. outgoing/incoming/both, invalid→400. |
| #343 | planning: mark #329/#331 done | Shape-A. |
| #344 | property values store as `TypeJSON` not `%v` (refs #224) | Storage/REST half. **Merged briefly RED** — its `pkg/api` test failed but CI didn't run pkg/api (see §6). |
| #345 | GraphQL serializes via shared converter (closes #224) | Unified 5 divergent serializers onto `storage.ValueToJSON`/`PropertiesToJSON`; fixed the red test from #344. |
| #346 | CI: run pkg/api + pkg/graphql in test allowlist | The fix for the §6 gap. macOS test job now runs both. |
| #347 | Cypher CREATE/MERGE param substitution (closes #237) | handler → `ExecuteWithParamsContext`; `convertCreateProperty` fails loud on unresolved `$param`. |
| #348 | graphdb-admin `login` + `mint-token` (closes #226) | First PR gated by the expanded CI; caught a gofmt-only failure (see §6). |
| #349 | HNSW cost reframe (closes #248) | `BenchmarkHNSWInsert_Clustered` (realistic) vs uniform worst case; 7.7× gap measured. |
| #350 | planning: close #224/#237/#226/#248 + CI gap | Shape-A. **Open/merging at handoff time** — verify merged. |

## Current state

- `origin/main` HEAD: `12afba8` (#349) at write time; #350 (docs) merging.
- Open PRs: #350 only (docs, no-risk). No open branches besides this handoff's.
- Uncommitted changes: none (besides `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`, harness-local).
- Tests: full `pkg/storage` (500s), `pkg/api`, `pkg/graphql`, `pkg/query`, `pkg/vector`, `cmd/graphdb-admin` all green locally; lint 0 issues; `gofmt -l` clean.

## What's next

Per `docs/NEXT_STEPS_2026-06-03.md`: **no critical path is forced.** The only remaining productization item is the **Python SDK M2** (ergonomic facades for hybrid-search/embeddings/`/v1/retrieve`/query/graphql/admin/tenants/apikeys) — spec/plan at `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-04-python-sdk-*.md`, memory `project_python_sdk`. Other operability items still open (onboarding docs, single-node framing, deployment-ordering note).

### New CI-hygiene follow-ups surfaced this session (not yet ticketed)

### CI-hygiene follow-ups surfaced this session — both FIXED

1. **`cmd/graphdb-admin` added to the CI test allowlist** (#352) — its #348 login/mint-token tests now run in CI (`TEST_PKGS` + `RACE_PKGS`). *Remaining:* the broad `./cmd/...` (benchmark exercisers, interactive `tui`) is still out, pending a runtime check that they fit the 10m budget and aren't interactive.
2. **`golangci-lint` now enforces `gofmt` in `cmd/`** (#353) — the formatters block had excluded `cmd/`, which is why #348's misformat passed lint but failed CI's `go fmt` step. `golangci-lint run` now catches it locally.

## Stale assumptions to retire

- **`project_python_sdk` memory** listed 4 graphdb gaps as "not yet fixed" — all four are now fixed (#334/#341/#332/#342). Already updated in memory this session.
- **`NEXT_STEPS_2026-06-03.md` line 161** "Remaining productization item: SDK M2" is now the *only* remaining item — #224/#237/#226/#248/#329/#331 are all closed (updated in #350).
- Any assumption that "CI green ⇒ all packages tested" is **false** for this repo — see new memory `feedback_graphdb_ci_test_gaps`.

## Open questions for the user

- None outstanding. (The two CI-hygiene follow-ups were fixed this session — #352, #353. The only deferred item is whether the broad `./cmd/...` belongs in the CI test allowlist; it needs a runtime check first.)

## How to use this handoff

1. Read this first.
2. Then `docs/NEXT_STEPS_2026-06-03.md` (§ "How to use this document").
3. Then `CLAUDE.md` § "Orient first" (auto-loaded).
4. If picking up SDK M2: read `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-python-sdk-*.md` + `clients/python/`.
